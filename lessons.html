        These lessons, which are completely free to use, have been designed with the UK’s Key Stage 3 PSHE and SMSC curricula in mind, though they can easily be modified for:
      </p>
      <p>
        Students in Key Stages 4 and 5
        Students in other countries
        Other subjects such as English, History, Geography, Biology and Religious Studies
        Educational contexts other than schools (archaeology/history clubs, museums, wellbeing classes)
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall aims of these lessons are:
      </p>
      <p>
        To use archaeological evidence to encourage discussion of our assumptions and misconceptions about human nature, i.e. ‘what it means to be human’
        To challenge existing assumptions about humans, and to understand how these assumptions affect our lives and those of others
        To encourage students to talk about a range of issues relating to mental health, well-being and prosocial behaviour, in turn encouraging increased social and emotional intelligence
      </p>
      <p>
        These lessons should be able to be taught by teachers with no prior knowledge of prehistory or archaeology, though you will find it beneficial to look through the evidence provided on the website beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        These lessons are designed to offer an engaging, alternative introduction to concepts such as compassion, diversity and collaboration, all of which are beneficial for students’ personal well-being. The discussions and activities within these lessons should improve emotional self-awareness and enable students to develop their understanding of difficult feelings. The lessons should allow students to critically analyse their own opinions, in a non-judgemental and open environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lessons are designed to be used chronologically, though each lesson can be extended to cover more than one session. If you are covering Lessons 2 or 3 without having taught Lesson 1, please ensure that students have watched the introductory animation/video first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timings given are only guidance, and provide minimum times for each activity. You may find it worthwhile, depending on the needs of your students, to spend longer on certain activities, particularly the discussions, and could spread the contents of the lesson over more than one session. Similarly, if you teach PSHE and SMSC in smaller chunks (e.g. during a 20-30 minute session first thing in the morning), these lessons can easily be split up and used over a number of sessions.

        Just like today, people in the past sometimes got sick and injured.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can look at evidence of recovery from illness and injury, and support for disability in the past to give us a better idea of if and how people were cared for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore the examples below to look for clues for care in the distant past. While you look over the evidence, think about how their illness, injury or disability would have affected their everyday life, and the lives of the people around them. Would they have needed around-the-clock care, or would they simply have needed a little aid from others every now and then?

      It looks like this woman had ‘hypervitaminosis A’ (an overdose of vitamin A), which can be caused by eating carnivore liver or bee brood. Both foods are an amazing source of energy, but too much can make you very ill.

      </h5>
      <p>
        This woman would have been ill for weeks, perhaps even months, and the illness which caused the extra bone on her legs was most likely the cause of her death. An overdose of vitamin A would have caused her a lot of pain for a long period of time - weeks or even months - before her death.

      <p>
        He had severe osteoarthritis in his spine and shoulder joints, as well as arthritis of the jaw. His left hip was breaking down and infected.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had also lost a large number of his teeth long before death, and had severe gum disease.

        How would this have affected them?
      </h5>
      <p>
        The osteoarthritis in his back and shoulder, and his hip problems, would have affected his ability to move. The problems with his jaw and mouth would probably have made it quite difficult to chew food.

      <h5>What illnesses/injuries did they have?</h5>
      <p>
        While he had accumulated many injuries by the time he died, they had healed long before death. His injuries may have been the result of a rock fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        His right arm had withered, and he had lost his lower arm and hand. The arm had been fractured but had healed, though he may have been paralysed on his right side.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blow to the face had healed completely, but one side of his face was permanently deformed, with blindness in one eye and a hearing impairment.

        His leg and foot bones were misshapen, and he probably would have had a painful limp.
      </p>
      <h5>How would this have affected them?</h5>
      <p>
        He would have had much more limited mobility, struggled to hear and see and wouldn’t have been able to walk as far as others.

        He would have looked different to the others in his group, and as a child may have taken longer to develop and walk. Physically, he would have had a limited range of movement in his arms and hands. He would have had mobility issues, struggling to walk for long periods of time without getting very tired, and his strength would have been more limited
